## Intro

This is a setting-agnostic, rules-light, cooperative narrative system. It focuses on human-readable descriptions instead of numerical stats, uses a single d6 roll to resolve most uncertain situations, and has only one persistent resource that players manage directly.

<span style={{color: "#f30"}}>The system</span> does not attempt to simulate tactical combat, economics, physics, or injury mechanics. Instead, it focuses on pacing tension and trusts the table to decide what makes sense within the fiction. The GM is more of a guardrail than an enforcer – this requires the players to be responsible for their own share of the fun at the table and not only to make optimal decisions mechanically – but it rewards them with agency.

Characters are competent people who usually succeed at what they do. When things go wrong, it is not because they are foolish or inept, but because they are tired, pressured, afraid, stretched too thin, or facing circumstances beyond their control.

Dice do not determine outcomes on their own. Instead, players decide how much effort their characters are willing to invest to overcome problems, and accept the consequences when they choose not to.

## Rolling dice and spending energy

![](./022.jpg)

Energy is the only persistent resource tracked in the game. It represents a player's character's overall capacity to push through uncertainty: physical endurance, mental focus, emotional resilience, confidence, luck, and the will to keep going. It is not health, it is not a measure of much sleep a character had, and it is not a measure of how injured or capable a character is – even though it is related to all of these.

When a character has plenty of energy, small mistakes can be compensated for. A bad roll might be corrected by spending energy: they adjust their grip at the last moment, find the right words after a faux pas, steady their breathing, or change their approach mid-action. When energy runs low, those same small errors become decisive.

Spending energy is also a narrative choice. It represents effort, strain, focus, or commitment. When a player spends energy, they are saying, "This matters to my character." When they choose not to, or cannot, spend it, they are accepting that the character hesitates, falters, or pulls back – and the world responds accordingly.

Running out of energy is not a special state. Characters at low or zero energy are not helpless or unconscious. They can still act, but they have no margin left. At that point, mistakes are final.

Energy is regained through rest, safety, comfort, and emotional relief. A good night's sleep, a warm meal, familiar surroundings, or a moment of genuine inspiration can all restore energy. How much is recovered depends on how those circumstances affect the specific character. Check [[#Energy reserves and restoration]].

Throughout play, energy functions as a pacing tool. When energy is high, characters can push themselves and explore risky situations. As energy drains, tension rises, decisions become harder, and the story naturally shifts toward rest, retreat, or resolution.

### Rolls

Whenever a character attempts something where failure would meaningfully change the situation, and time pressure, danger, or uncertainty is involved, the GM may call for a roll, let the action succeed by default, or inform the player that it will fail in the current situation – giving them an option to change their course of action. Check [[#Loop of play]] for more information.

To resolve a roll:
1. The GM sets a difficulty from 1 to 6, based on how taxing the task is for that character, using their gear, in their current situation. Most rolls should be between 1 and 3. A roll with difficulty 6 cannot succeed without spending energy and should be reserved for rare situations. Check [[#Setting difficulty of rolls]] for more information.
2. Difficulty can be or can be not disclosed to the players, depending on whether their characters would be able to judge if their attempt succeeded or failed.
3. The player rolls one d6.
4. If the result is higher than the difficulty, the action succeeds.

In a way, roll results can be thought of as a way to determine the energy cost of an action instead of a coin flip to determine whether the action succeeded or not.

After seeing the die result, but before the outcome is narrated, the player may choose to spend any amount of energy to improve the result.
- Each point of energy spent increases the roll by 1.
- The player may spend any amount of energy they have available.
- If the final result exceeds the difficulty, the action succeeds.
- Whenever it makes sense, the GM may rule that spending at least one energy on a failed roll makes the consequences less dire and communicate that to the player clearly.

### Hidden difficulties

In some situations, the character cannot reasonably know how close they are to success. In these cases, the GM does not have to reveal the difficulty before the roll.

Common examples include:
- Searching for hidden information
- Investigating an unfamiliar environment
- Judging subtle social reactions

Players may still spend one point of energy (not any amount as in rolls with known difficulty) after rolling, but are committing effort without knowing whether it will be enough.

Check [[#Consequences of failure]] for more information.

### Degrees and types of success and failure

Many times the simple information if a roll succeeded or not is not enough. That's when the GM or the player in question may interpret the mechanical result narratively.

- Success achieved by a pure roll and success achieved by spending energy are mechanically identical, but they may be narrated differently to reflect effort, strain, or desperation.
- Failing a difficulty 1 roll and deciding not to use energy, while having a lot of it, can be narrated as the character not caring enough about the task. Doing the same when low on energy can be said to be an effect of exhaustion.
- Rolling a 2 on a difficulty 1 roll shows that the character is competent. Rolling a 5 gives the player or GM an opportunity to add flair.
- Rolling a 1 is not a critical fail, rolling a 6 is not a critical success. But the table is free to interpret rolls that land far away either way from the required difficulty narratively.

These do not change the outcome of a roll, only the framing.

## Setting difficulty of rolls

Difficulty is not a measure of how difficult an action is in the abstract. Difficulty is always relative to the character and fiction. The same action may not require a roll at all for one character, be difficulty 2 for another, and difficulty 4 for someone else, depending on their background, preparation, tools, and expectations. A professional climber ascending a cliff in good conditions will not roll. The same climb during a storm, while injured, or while carrying someone else becomes uncertain enough to justify a roll.

Most actions characters take should simply work. Rolls are reserved for situations where pressure, risk, or limited opportunity make the outcome genuinely unclear. A locksmith opening a door in their own workshop, a medic treating a small wound with proper supplies in safety, or a scholar recalling common historical facts do not roll. Even if the action would be impressive in real life, competence plus favorable conditions remove uncertainty.

Likewise, if failure would not change the situation in an interesting way, a roll is unnecessary. Picking a mundane lock when nothing is chasing the characters, climbing a wall they can retry as many times as they want, or shooting a dummy target with no one watching does not require dice. The GM should assume eventual success and move on.

A roll becomes appropriate when at least one of the following is true in the fiction:
- time is limited,
- attempts are limited,
- failure has bad consequences.

**To set the difficulty, answer two questions on a scale from 0 to 3 and set the difficulty to their sum. Resulting in a number between 0 and 6 – that is what is communicated to the players.** Zero here means that the roll was unnecessary to begin with, the action succeeds automatically.
### 1. How likely are problems to occur?

- **0** – The character is prepared to tackle the challenge and the circumstances make mistakes possible but unlikely.
- **1** – It is likely that the character will not make any mistakes, but it won't be surprising if something goes wrong anyway.
- **2** – It is more likely than not that something will go wrong.
- **3** – The task is possible but problems are almost completely unavoidable.

These mistakes can be the result of the character lacking the required skills or equipment, the situation being unfavorable, or pure bad luck.

### 2. How hard is it to fix these problems?

- **0** – The challenge can be retried without much trouble or the possible problems have easy solutions.
- **1** – Problems can be overcome with a bit of time and/or effort.
- **2** – Problems can be overcome with considerable time and/or effort.
- **3** – It is almost impossible to fix it, once something goes wrong.

### What influences difficulty

Both questions are character-relative. Experience, preparation, gear, and familiarity can reduce difficulty or remove the need for a roll entirely. The only factor that does not influence difficulty in this way is their current energy level.

Imagine a scenario when your character has to fight off a drunk in a bar.

What makes it harder:
- they're naturally weak,
- they're hungover or drunk themselves,
- they are injured,
- the drunk surprised them,
- the drunk has an improvised weapon.

What makes it easier:
- they're strong and nimble,
- they have experience in bar fights,
- they're wearing armor,
- they have a weapon,
- they suspected that they will be attacked.

None of these have mechanics attached to them. The table can make their case about what makes them have an easy time in the situation and then the GM decides how that translates to difficulty. Once the GM has enough information to decide, they should do so and move on.

Finally, remember that not rolling is a deliberate design choice. Letting characters succeed automatically reinforces that they are competent people in a coherent world. Rolls should feel like turning points, not background noise. When dice hit the table, it should be clear to everyone that something is genuinely at stake.

Furthermore, a higher difficulty doesn't always make the situation more interesting. Before calling for a high-difficulty roll, always consider if it would not make more sense to divide it into smaller rolls or declare the action as impossible.

If uncertain, setting difficulty to 2 as a default is better than overanalyzing.

### Group actions

Group actions occur when multiple characters work toward the same outcome, and the result depends on more than one person's performance. They are used when coordination, shared risk, or mutual dependence matter in the fiction.

1. Decide who needs to succeed

Before any rolls are made, the table decides which characters are crucial to the action and which are supporting or redundant, based purely on the fiction.

Examples:
- Sneaking together through a guarded hallway: everyone is crucial.
- Searching a large room: at least one person needs to succeed.
- Distracting an opponent to deliver a decisive blow: at least two people must succeed, one distracting, one attacking

2. Assign difficulty per character

Each participating character rolls separately and may have a different difficulty, based on their role, preparation, tools, experience, and current situation. Difficulty is always character-relative.

3. Everyone rolls

All involved characters roll once and may spend energy on their own roll as usual. If all crucial characters succeed, the group action succeeds. If one or more crucial characters fail, the group action is in danger of failing.

4. Covering for failure

If a crucial character fails, a character who succeeded may attempt to cover for the mistake, if and only if it makes sense in the fiction. Covering represents reacting instantly to chaos: grabbing someone before they fall, stepping into an opening, drawing attention away, or compensating for a lapse.

- The covering character immediately makes another roll.
- The difficulty of this roll is 1 higher than their original difficulty, but it can be adjusted based on fiction.
- Energy may be spent as usual.

There is no fixed limit to how many failures a character may attempt to cover, but each attempt must be fictionally justified, and the difficulty should rise quickly as the situation deteriorates.

If a cover roll succeeds:
- The group action succeeds.
- The success is narrow, frantic, or hard-won.
- No automatic mechanical penalty is applied; the cost is narrative.

If a cover roll fails:
- The outcome is worse than if no one had tried to cover.
- Consequences should escalate, spread, or compound.

#### Examples

Covering is not abstract protection. It depends on position, timing, and plausibility.

**Crossing a narrow path over a chasm**
Four characters cross together. One succeeds, three fail.
- The successful character might realistically grab or stabilize the person directly next to them.
- They cannot reasonably catch three people several meters away unless they introduce a rope, magic, or a clever plan.
- The GM should simply disallow impossible cover attempts.

**Ganging up on an opponent**
Two characters attack together.
- If one falters, the other can step in, draw attention, or take a hit meant for them.
- Trying to cover and failing may leave both exposed, instead of only one.

**Sneaking as a group**  
One character makes a noise.
- Another might distract a guard or pull the group into cover.
- Trying to fix multiple simultaneous mistakes quickly becomes implausible.

The GM's role is not to limit heroics, but to protect coherence.  
If the explanation makes little sense, the cover attempt should not be allowed. If it requires both luck and skill, it's a good moment for a high-difficulty roll.

## Consequences of failure

Failure is a change in the situation that follows logically from the character's action and circumstances. It is not a punishment and not a punchline.

The choice to spend or not spend energy should be based on what the character reasonably understands about the risk. The GM's role is to communicate that understanding clearly, without overcommitting to outcomes that are not yet determined.

When clarifying stakes before a roll, the GM should distinguish between:
- **The event**: what immediately goes wrong if the attempt fails.
- **The consequences**: what follows from that event.

The GM should clarify the likely event of failure before the roll when:
- The failure could lead to serious harm or irreversible change.
- The character has relevant experience and would anticipate the risk.
- A group action or potential cover attempt could escalate consequences.

The GM does not need to explain consequences when:
- The character lacks information in the fiction.
- The situation is unfolding too quickly for the character to assess.
- Discovering the risk is itself part of the tension.

Hidden consequences should arise from in-fiction ignorance, never from omitted information the character would clearly perceive.

Good:
- "They'll know you're hiding something."
- "You'll lose your footing."
- "The lock will jam."
- "They'll notice movement."

Avoid:
- "They'll know you're hiding something and start interrogating you."
- "You'll lose your footing and break your leg."
- "The lock will jam and the guards will arrive."

Those follow-up consequences may happen, but they depend on how the situation develops after the failure.

On the other hand, the GM should be explicit about severity when the character can clearly assess the danger, even if the exact outcome is uncertain.

Examples:
- "If you fall here, breaking your legs or worse is highly likely."
- "If this explodes, you're in the blast radius."
- "If you miss this jump, there's nothing to grab onto."

In these cases, describing likely consequences is not spoiling tension; it reflects obvious in-world knowledge. If misjudgment here happens, and it will, there is nothing wrong with rolling the situation back – but only if the alternative is illogical in-fiction, not simply uncomfortable to the player.

The GM may describe outcomes using terms like "likely," "unlikely but possible," "very dangerous," "probably survivable," and similar. When the GM does this, they are not locking in results, only communicating risk. If the table wants to preserve uncertainty, or if no one is sure what would logically follow, an oracle roll is a good idea to resolve what happens after the failure.

### Failure as a narrative moment

Whenever possible, failure should give the player a chance to respond in the fiction. This does not mean undoing the failure, but engaging with it:
- Choosing whether to press on or withdraw,
- Reacting emotionally or socially,
- Changing approach entirely, asking for help, retreating, moving from fighting to negotiating or vice versa.

Failure is an opportunity to show character, not just to mark a loss.

### Ongoing strain, deprivation, and other debuffs

Some conditions hinder characters beyond a single roll. These should be written down and kept visible at the table to ensure they are remembered and consistently applied. 
Debuffs are always fictional first. They do not impose fixed modifiers, but they shape what the character can reasonably do, increase difficulty, and in severe cases drain energy simply to keep functioning.

A debuff is any ongoing condition that meaningfully interferes with the character's ability to act. Common examples include:
- Sleep deprivation
- Hunger or dehydration
- Exposure to cold, heat, or wet conditions
- Ongoing pain or untreated injury
- Fear, shock, guilt, or emotional distress
- Impaired senses (darkness, smoke, ringing ears)
- Injuries

If possible, it is a good idea to write these down as separate notes that can be then handed to the players to make everyone remember them. The note should include the time the condition was acquired, to make it easier to decide when it should be discarded during downtime.

Debuffs apply pressure in two main ways:

1. Increased difficulty

When a debuff is relevant to an action, the GM should increase the difficulty or rule the action impossible without first addressing the condition.

Examples:
- Fine manual work while hands are numb from cold.
- Careful reasoning while severely sleep-deprived.
- Sprinting on an injured leg.
- Persuading someone while visibly shaken or exhausted.

This increase stacks naturally with other sources of pressure. There is no fixed value; the fiction determines how severe the interference is.

Some debuffs limit what the character can attempt at all.

Examples:
- A character who is barely conscious cannot keep watch effectively.
- A panicked character may be unable to act subtly or patiently.

The GM should state these limits plainly when they matter.

2. Energy drain under severe conditions

In extreme cases, debuffs do not just make actions harder — they actively consume energy just to stay functional. When a character reaches a severe condition that would, in reality, risk collapse or loss of consciousness, the following applies:
- The character loses 1 energy every 3 hours they continue without relief.
- This loss represents the effort required simply to remain awake, mobile, or coherent.
- This drain occurs regardless of rolls or actions taken and it is cumulative with any energy spent on rolls.

This baseline applies after the condition becomes severe, not from the first missed meal or bad night.

Examples of severe conditions:
- 48 hours without sleep.
- Extended dehydration.
- Prolonged exposure to cold or heat without protection.
- Severe pain left untreated.
- Shock or emotional overload that the character is actively suppressing.

The GM should make it clear when a condition crosses into this threshold.

#### Relief and recovery

Debuffs persist until they are fictionally addressed.

Examples:
- Sleeping removes sleep deprivation.
- Drinking and resting alleviates dehydration.
- Warming up and drying out reduces cold-related strain.
- Treatment, time, or safety may be required for injuries or shock.

Removing a debuff does not automatically restore energy. Energy recovery still follows the normal rules for rest and comfort. 

## Energy reserves and restoration

Energy is recovered through rest, safety, comfort, and emotional relief. Recovery is not automatic, and it is not guaranteed to fully restore a character. How much energy is regained depends on how the downtime affects the character in the fiction.

### Daily recovery

Under normal circumstances, a character can recover up to 9 energy per day through rest and downtime. This is a cap, not a guarantee. A character's maximum energy may be higher, usually in the 9 to 13 range, but recharging that maximum requires more than a single day of rest after draining themselves completely.

### What counts as rest

Rest is any period where the character is at least able to fall asleep. But there's more to it than just the duration of sleep, even if that's a part of it. Restoring 9 points requires fulfilling most of these:
- familiar or comfortable surroundings,
- not being hungry, thirsty, too warm or cold,
- engaging in calming or grounding downtime activities,
- being mentally calm.

Typical recovery amounts:
- Brief rest (nap, short break): 2 energy
- Uncomfortable or unsafe night's rest, taking one shift of the watch: 4–6 energy
- Decent rest in reasonable conditions, after a pleasant evening: 7–8 energy
- Excellent rest, safe, comfortable, emotionally settled: up to 9 energy

Recovery is personal.

- A character may recover more energy in a familiar home or personal hideout.
- Crowded or unfamiliar places may reduce recovery for some characters.
- Other characters may recover better in social, lively environments. For them spending half of the night at a social gathering might actually aid energy recovery.
- Guilt, fear, grief, or shock caused by recent events can limit recovery, even in good conditions.
- Characters reminiscing about recent events, reframing them from a different perspective, helping each other cope, can all increase the quality of rest.

The GM may ask players how their characters feel about the situation and use that to guide recovery.

### Inspiration and exceptional moments

In rare cases, a character may recover 1–2 energy outside of normal rest. These moments represent:
- Genuine inspiration
- Emotional breakthroughs
- Acts of courage or meaning
- Being deeply moved or supported

This recovery does not count against the daily recovery cap and should be rare and meaningful. It is not a reward for success, but for significance.

### Recovery as pacing

Recovery is a pacing tool, not a resource faucet. When energy is low, the story naturally leans toward rest, retreat, or resolution. Multi-day recovery encourages downtime scenes, character interaction, and reflection. Limited recovery discourages reckless escalation and adds consequences beyond a single day.

The GM is not expected to drain energy every scene, nor to fully restore it constantly. Exhaustion and recovery should reflect the rhythm of the story.

On a fairly typical day with several tense moments most characters will spend 5–7 energy total – which is the amount they can reasonably expect to recover during the night. Starting a new day slightly below maximum energy is expected during an adventure. All characters ending the day at 0–2 energy should signal extraordinary exertion, bad luck, or deliberate escalation. If characters end a day without spending much energy, some recovery potential will be wasted and that is not a reason to adjust.

Spending energy during downtime is fine as well, but it shouldn't drain characters to the point where they can't wake up rested the next day.

## Progress Trackers

Progress trackers are visible markers that represent slow-moving change in the fiction: plans unfolding, dangers building, searches advancing, resources running out, or attention being drawn. They exist to make pressure legible and to help the table reason about time and progress. They are primarily a tool for the GM, but players often can benefit from having them placed openly on the table. To worry about them, plan around them, try to fill them, or just ignore them.

Uses include:
- guards becoming suspicious
- an enemy completing a plan
- a storm closing in
- a character's unresolved emotional state reaching a breaking point
- a long-term project nearing completion
- a long travel reaching its end

Trackers can be tied to just about anything, good or bad, as long as the table sees merit in tracking its progress.

When introducing a public tracker, the GM should state what its completion is likely to change, without locking in exact outcomes.   

Trackers typically have 4 to 8 segments. It can be anything from a proper progress bar filled with tokens, a piece of paper with empty boxes, or just a die that will be rotates on each change. The exact number doesn't actually matter that much as the GM can modulate the speed it fills. It reflects how many meaningful opportunities there are to intervene before the situation changes. Trackers do not need to be symmetrical or uniform. A tracker may start partially filled if the situation is already underway.

A tracker advances when something in the fiction logically pushes it forward.
- Time passing under pressure
- Failed rolls
- Characters choosing speed, noise, or visibility over caution
- Ignoring a known problem

Sometimes a tracker advances by 1 segment. Sometimes it advances by several at once. The GM should avoid advancing trackers mechanically per roll or per scene. Advancement should be tied logically to the cause, not procedural.

Players cannot spend energy to directly change or erase a tracker. Trackers are not obstacles to be beaten, they are merely representations of them. However, player actions can:
- Slow a tracker's advance
- Reduce it
- Replace it with a different tracker
- Trigger its resolution early
- Or remove it completely

Examples:
- Creating a distraction might halt an "Alert Guards" tracker.
- Changing plans could replace "Search the Warehouse" with "Escape the District."
- Confronting an NPC directly may collapse a "Suspicion" tracker into an immediate social conflict.
- Leaving the area might remove the "Guards closing in" tracker.

If an action directly and decisively undermines what the tracker represents, the GM should reduce it or remove it without requiring a special mechanic.

### When a tracker fills

When the last segment is filled, the situation changes. This is not automatically a failure for the players, but it is never neutral.
- A new threat enters play
- The stakes escalate sharply
- A window of opportunity closes
- A long-term effort completes

The GM should inform the table about the change immediately but not about its consequences unless they are known to the characters. If appropriate, the filled tracker may be then removed or changed to something else.

### Multiple trackers and shared pressure

It is normal to have several trackers active at once in tense scenes, or no trackers at all when there's not much happening. The tension of play often comes from deciding which problems to engage with and which to let worsen.

Trackers are especially useful when:
- The group splits attention
- Time pressure matters
- NPCs pursue goals independently
- Consequences need to be visible but not immediate
- Player characters pursue long-term goals

The GM should be cautious not to overwhelm the table. If many trackers are active, they should represent distinct pressures, not variations of the same problem.

## Loop of play

Play follows a loose, repeating rhythm driven by the fiction rather than turns or phases. The rules exist to support this rhythm, not replace it.

1. Establish the situation

The GM describes what is currently happening, what has changed since the last scene, and what pressures are present. The goal is not exhaustive detail, but shared understanding. If players act in ways that suggest they misunderstood the situation, the GM should clarify before play continues.

2. Players declare intent

Players describe what their characters want to achieve and how they approach it. They are encouraged to frame actions in terms of intent and attitude rather than specific mechanics.

3. Decide whether uncertainty matters

The GM decides whether the declared action:
- Is impossible in the fiction
- Requires a roll because the outcome is meaningfully uncertain
- Succeeds automatically

If the action is impossible, the GM should say so plainly and explain why. Players may then revise their approach or accept the outcome.

If no roll is needed, the fiction advances directly.

When a roll is called for, the GM:
- Considers the character, their ongoing conditions, and the situation
- Sets difficulty relative to that character
- Clarifies the immediate event of failure when appropriate
- Withholds information when ignorance itself is part of the tension

The player rolls one d6 and may then choose to spend energy after seeing the result. This choice represents effort, strain, or commitment in response to bad luck or pressure.

4. Resolve and update the fiction

The outcome is narrated. Success or failure changes the situation: new opportunities appear, risks escalate, positions shift, injuries occur, attention is drawn, or pressure eases.

Any new ongoing conditions should be written down and kept visible.

5. Check pressure and energy

After resolving the outcome, the table implicitly reassesses the state of play:
- Are characters becoming strained or exhausted?
- Is energy approaching the danger zone?
- Is the situation escalating, stabilizing, or winding down?

When energy is low and immediate threats are resolved or avoided, play naturally shifts toward reflection, recovery, travel, planning, or downtime.

When energy is low but threats remain, players must decide whether to push harder, change approach, disengage, or accept the consequences of hesitation.

The loop then repeats from the updated situation.

### Shared narrative authority

The GM is the final authority on the fiction, but players are encouraged to actively contribute ideas beyond their characters' immediate actions. This system assumes a collaborative table where good ideas are welcomed regardless of who proposes them.

Among other things, players may suggest:
- Plausible details about the environment
- Complications, twists, or side effects
- Ways a situation resolves or escalates
- Retroactive explanations that reframe what is happening, if they fit the fiction

These suggestions are not binding. The GM may accept them, modify them, or reject them if they break coherence, tone, or established facts.

If a player proposal negates a consequence, reframes a failure into success, or removes existing pressure, and it gets accepted, they must spend 2 energy.

Proposals that introduce risk, cost, or escalation may restore 1–2 Energy, at the GM's discretion.

### No turn order or action economy

There is no initiative order, rounds, or action economy. Who acts next is decided by the fiction. In tense situations, players are encouraged to describe their general approach rather than individual moves. The GM may resolve entire exchanges, fights, or standoffs with one roll per character, or a small number of rolls that reflect changing circumstances.

The purpose of this is to keep conflicts focused on intent, risk, and consequence rather than simulation.

In situations where time, danger, or pressure are present, every character is assumed to be doing something. If only some players have described their characters' actions, the GM should explicitly ask the remaining players what their characters are doing. "I do nothing" or "I wait and watch" are valid answers. They represent hesitation, caution, or withdrawal.

When a character remains passive in a tense situation, the GM should reflect that choice in the fiction. Threats advance, opportunities pass, enemies try to use the opening.

## Example of play

// TODO

## Character creation

Characters are defined primarily through description, not numbers. The character sheet exists to communicate who the character is, what comes easily to them, what drains them, and how they fit into the story. A character can be created with very little information. Anything not explicitly defined is assumed to be average for the setting.

To play, a character must have:
- Name
- Basic appearance, such as age, sex, and ancestry or race (if applicable in the setting)
- Maximum energy, usually 10, unless the GM agrees otherwise

A character created with only this information is fully playable. They are assumed to be competent, reasonably healthy, and unremarkable in most areas.

While not required, most characters benefit from additional descriptive elements. These do not grant fixed bonuses or penalties. Instead, they guide the GM when deciding:
- Whether a roll is needed
- How difficult a roll should be
- How failure and recovery are framed in the fiction

### Traits

Traits describe notable strengths and weaknesses. They do not provide numerical modifiers. Their purpose is to shape difficulty and narration. It's a good idea to write these in pairs, reflecting trade-offs rather than pure advantages, like:
- Exceptionally strong, but gets exhausted quickly
- Well-read and knowledgeable, but socially awkward
- Fearless in danger, but reckless and impatient

Depending on the tone of the game, the GM may allow characters to have more positive traits than negative ones, or vice versa.

### Background and profession

Marking a character's background or profession answers a simple question: What kind of problems does this character know how to handle? A profession often removes the need for rolls in familiar situations, or lowers the difficulty when pressure is present.

Players may also list three things their character is good at, but not a specialist or master in. Examples: "Decent climber," "Knows how to read people," "Can patch wounds in the field," "Speaks a little of several languages."

These are meant to signal comfort and experience, not exceptional skill. There's no need to overthink the mechanical implication of your choices here, as, with the GM's approval, character details may be established retroactively during play. Like revealing prior experience when encountering a specific situation or establishing a past job, contact, or familiarity that logically fits the fiction. This gives the table an ability to adjust mid-game, so that everyone's character is what they were imagining and is fun to play.

These elements primarily inform whether a roll is needed and how [[#Setting difficulty of rolls]] is handled.

### Relationships

It is strongly recommended that players coordinate with each other and describe how their characters know one another and why they trust or rely on each other. These connections help anchor the group and give emotional weight to both success and failure.

### Rest preferences and temperament

Because recovery depends on comfort and mindset, players are encouraged to describe whether the character prefers solitude or companionship when exhausted and how they typically respond to stress or failure.

### Defining compulsion

Choose one type of action that encapsulates your character's core principles. Performing this action will increase your energy.

- Telling the truth when a lie would be more convenient.
- Doing something dangerous when there's a clear reward for it.
- Splitting a complex task into sub-tasks.
- Doing something to impress or woo an attractive person.

### A guiding principle

It's good to communicate to your GM what kind of character you want to play. Maybe you want to start as an underdog that the party has to carry, but then gradually become more competent. Maybe you want to always try and resolve conflicts peacefully. Maybe you want to be a beautiful noble girl with a lot of connections but be useless in a fight. Maybe you want to charge into battle first and then discus philosophy over tea and cookies. Maybe you want the entire party to be perceived as being exceptional, or maybe you want them to struggle to survive.

Ask yourself what kind of game you want to play and coordinate with the GM and/or other players.

## Character progression

Progress in is primarily narrative, not numerical. Characters change because their circumstances change. They gain access to better tools, safer places, influential people, and material security. These things expand what the character can reasonably attempt, reduce uncertainty, and reshape the kinds of problems that matter to them.

Most advancement happens organically through play. Acquiring specialized gear can turn previously dangerous tasks into routine ones, remove the need for rolls, or lower difficulties in high-pressure situations. New connections open doors, provide protection, offer information, or create obligations that reshape the story. Wealth and resources buy time, comfort, leverage, and options, often indirectly improving recovery, preparation, and positioning before rolls ever occur.

### Milestones and personal change

Occasionally, usually after a significant story milestone, a character may change in a more internal or descriptive way. This might represent lessons learned, shifts in confidence, or the slow accumulation of experience or muscle. Characters' traits, background details, habits, or even maximum energy may be updated, but only when the character is at full energy, rested, and safe. This represents the idea that real personal growth requires space to reflect, integrate experiences, and recover from strain.

Such updates should be modest and grounded in what has happened in play. A reckless character who survived several close calls might gain a note about staying calm in the face of danger. Someone who was once sheltered might now be described as hardened or alert. A character who repeatedly pushed themselves beyond their limits might increase their maximum energy slightly, or redefine what exhausts them and what restores them.

These changes are negotiated at the table, usually between sessions or during extended downtime scenes. They are meant to align the written description with how the character is already being played, not to suddenly redefine them.

### What progression is not

Progression is not a steady drip of mechanical rewards for attendance, nor a ladder of power that must be climbed to remain relevant. Characters do not become more effective because numbers went up, but because their world expanded and their relationship to it changed.

Likewise, suffering does not automatically produce growth. A character who is constantly exhausted, unsafe, or pressured may stagnate or even narrow in focus. That is also a valid outcome.

### Long-term play

Over a long campaign, characters may end up profoundly different from where they started, but their growth or fall should be grounded in the setting they inhabit. The goal of progression is not balance or optimization, but coherence. When a character changes, it should feel earned, understandable, and consistent with the story the table has been telling together.

### Magic

No idea. Wave your hands around and mumble something vaguely arcane-sounding?

### Physical components at the table

You don't really need anything physical on the table apart from a minimal character sheet and empty space for notes. But it's generally a good idea to have a number of small pieces of paper at hand, to write small status effects and important gear names on. Handing these to players makes it much easier to remember that someone had an injured leg, or that their backpack got drenched in water.

The system does not limit you in this regard though. You're free to use maps, terrain, minis, props, or whatever else you like. If you're really kinky, you can even track things in a spreadsheet.

### Common mistakes and good habits

- Don't feel the need to drain energy from your players in every scene, every day. Some days are just calm.
- Even a difficulty 1 roll should still only be used in situations that matter. Remember that it can still drain energy from the players. There's no need to make every roll dramatic.
